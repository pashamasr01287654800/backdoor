Android Backdoor

Purpose & Functionality:
The Android backdoor is engineered to allow injection with a wide range of malicious payloads. It comes pre-configured with all the necessary fixes and permissions, making it function like a stubborn Trojan horse. Once deployed, it runs continuously in the background, making it extremely difficult for an average user to remove.

Testing & Compatibility:
The tool has been successfully tested with numerous injection utilities, including the popular AhMyth framework, ensuring its robustness and reliability in various scenarios.

Linux Backdoor

The Linux backdoor is available in two variants, each tailored for different post-exploitation scenarios:

1. Manual Variant

Deployment:
This version is typically uploaded after an initial penetration and is used for post-exploitation activities.

Key Features:

Persistent Connection: Automatically restarts itself to maintain continuous access.

Multi-location Installation: Installs itself in several locations and by various methods to ensure redundancy.

Service Integration: Can register itself as a service under any name specified by the user.

User Interaction: Prompts the user for essential details such as the type of service, host, and port, providing flexible configuration options.



2. Automatic Variant

Deployment & Functionality:
This variant operates on the same robust principles as the manual version but comes with pre-embedded configuration data within the code. It functions as a standard payload with all the advanced persistent features, eliminating the need for manual user input during deployment.

Final Notes

These backdoor tools are meant for research and learning within controlled, authorized environments. Unauthorized use or deployment on systems without explicit permission is illegal and unethical. By using these tools responsibly, you can better understand advanced penetration testing techniques and the importance of robust cybersecurity measures.
